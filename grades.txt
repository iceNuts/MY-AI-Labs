Dear Zeng Li,

Projects counted 50% of the grade:     You received 2+20+20+25+25=92 out of 92 possible points
     with an additional 7 for the contest.
The midterm counted 25% of the grade:  You achieved 52 out of 69 possible points.
The final counted 25% of the grade:    You achieved 61 out of 77 possible points.


Your total is therefore:
0.5*99.0/92.0+0.25*52.0/69.0+0.25*61.0/77.0+0.1*0.0/7.0=0.92, which resulted in a A as the final grade.
Sincerely,
         the Autograder
